# Python_ai_from_scratch
In my last futile attempt to get decent at machine learning I decided to write every method commonly used in AI from scratch (only using numpy and matplotlib). From 1D linear regression to complex neural networks, if it exists and is used in AI, you can probably find it here or will be able to at some point.
