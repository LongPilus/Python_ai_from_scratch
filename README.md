# Python_ai_from_scratch
In my futile attempt to improve at machine learning I decided to write every method commonly used in AI from scratch (only using numpy and matplotlib). From 1D linear regression to complex neural networks, if it exists and is used in AI, you can either find it here or will be able to at some point. Unless I get bored and stop, in which case you were right dad, I am a fuckup.
